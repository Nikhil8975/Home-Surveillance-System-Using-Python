# Home-Surveillance-System-Using-Python
This project uses OpenCV and Python to create a basic home surveillance system. It captures video from a webcam, detects faces using a Haar Cascade classifier, saves detected face images with timestamps, and compiles them into a video upon exit. Itâ€™s a simple, effective tool for basic face detection and monitoring.
